# climbuk-brand-pack for agents

Guidance for an AI agent working on or with this repository, assembled into one
file so it can be read in a single pass. Each example is a real file under
`ai-docs/src`, kept compiling by the repository type check. The people-facing
documentation covers the same ground in plain words; see the README.

## House standards

Every Resnovas repository follows the same standards. This section is synced from
[`Resnovas/.github`](https://github.com/Resnovas/.github); the rules come from
`AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AI_POLICY.md` and the PostHog skill
`coding-preferences`, and those documents win if this summary ever disagrees
with them. The sections after this one describe this repository itself.

### Code

- **Effect-TS v3 first.** TypeScript is the primary language, written with
  Effect v3: services as `Context.Tag` with `Layer`s, `Effect.gen` for
  sequencing, `Schema` to decode anything from outside the process. Load the
  PostHog skill `coding-preferences` and its `effect` reference before writing
  Effect code, and look up current APIs with Context7 rather than from memory.
- **Strict TypeScript, never `any`.** Keep `strict` on. Decode unknown input
  with `Schema` instead of casting it.
- **Typed errors.** Model failures as tagged errors (`Data.TaggedError` or
  `Schema.TaggedError`) in the error channel, so a caller sees every way a call
  can fail. Do not throw for expected failures.
- **Secrets through `Config` and `Redacted`.** Read configuration with
  Effect `Config`, and hold every secret as `Redacted` (`Config.redacted`)
  until the boundary that needs its value. Never put a secret in source, logs,
  telemetry, command-line arguments, issues or pull requests.
- **PostHog telemetry and feature flags.** Every app ships PostHog feature
  flags; new behaviour goes behind a flag with a safe default in code, never
  behind an environment variable or configuration toggle (house skill
  `feature-flags`). Telemetry events carry no secret or personal data.
- **Module boundaries.** The core package holds domain-agnostic building
  blocks only. Vendor SDKs and API clients live in
  `@resnovas/integrations.<vendor>`. Features depend on core and
  integrations, never the other way round (`AI_POLICY.md` AI-13).
- **Comments explain why.** Constraints, trade-offs and anything surprising;
  never a restatement of the code.

### Tests

- Write tests with `@effect/vitest`. Line and branch coverage never falls
  below 90%, and most repositories hold 100%.
- **Never delete, skip or weaken a test** to make a change pass: fix the code
  (`AI_POLICY.md` AI-11). A flaky test is a bug to fix, not to retry away.
- Every bug fix comes with a regression test that fails before the fix.

### TypeScript

- Effect-TS v3 is the foundation of all production TypeScript, in every
  repository (house skill `coding-preferences`, `references/effect.md`).
  Anything that does IO, can fail, reads configuration, retries, runs
  concurrently or holds a resource is an `Effect` with `Data.TaggedError`
  failures, services as `Context.Tag` classes behind a `Layer`, input through
  `Schema`, configuration through `Config`, tests with `@effect/vitest`, in
  the shape of the module's existing code.
- Raw Promise code (`async`, `await`, `try`/`catch`, `throw`, `new Promise`,
  `.then`) lives only at a vendor boundary inside an integration module, in
  the one `Effect.tryPromise` or `Effect.try` that wraps the vendor call,
  marked with `// effect-boundary: <reason>` on the line above. The commit
  hook refuses it anywhere else in added source lines, and refuses `any`.
- A pure function with no IO and no failure path stays plain TypeScript. A
  whole feature in plain TypeScript is never an agent's decision: it is a
  house-rule override only the accountable human gives, by naming the rule.

### Files

- Every source file carries the FCL-1.0-MIT licence header from
  `tools/license/header.txt`, with its own path on the second line and the
  current year. `node tools/license/check-headers.mjs` (the `headers` package
  script) verifies it and `--fix` writes it; synced house tools carry none.
- ASCII hyphen-minus only in text an agent writes: no em or en dashes, and no
  emoji in titles or descriptions (house skill `no-em-or-en-dashes`,
  `AI_POLICY.md` AI-09).

### Commits and pull requests

- Conventional commits (`type(scope): summary`, imperative mood), one logical
  change each, and every commit signed off for the Developer Certificate of
  Origin with the commit author's name and address. An AI tool never signs off
  (`AI_POLICY.md` AI-03).
- Every commit an AI tool materially changed carries one `Co-authored-by`
  trailer per tool naming the tool and the model at the tool's attribution
  address (`AI_POLICY.md` AI-02); the commit author and the sign-off are the
  accountable human. No "Generated with" footer, robot emoji or host session
  line (house skill `commits-and-rd-evidence`). `tools/dev/commit-check.mjs`,
  installed as the commit-msg hook by setup, refuses a commit that breaks
  these rules.
- A pull request an agent opens is a draft (`AI_POLICY.md` AI-20) and states
  `AI level: autonomous` and every tool and model used (AI-01); the
  accountable human fills in `Accountable human` and `Human review` when
  marking it ready (AI-21). No "Generated with" footer or session link.
- One pull request per batch of work: one stacked branch per issue, each
  squashed to one conventional, signed-off commit naming its issue, all opened
  as a single pull request. Once a maintainer approves it, it lands as an owner
  fast-forward (its signed commits pushed onto the default branch unchanged),
  so each issue keeps its own commit; the merge queue squashes, because GitHub
  cannot sign rebased commits. Run the full gate locally first; CI is not the
  debugger.
- Deterministic gates (the repository's checks and the `smartcloud` check)
  decide a merge. AI review bots are advisory.
- Releases are cut by the synced house release workflow from `release.config.json`
  at the repository root (what the repository ships: bundles, apps, the major
  tag, error tracking project, npm package); the tools under `tools/release/`
  are synced too. Never run `nx release` without `--dry-run`; the workflow is
  the only release path, and its first run in a repository takes a specifier
  with first-release ticked.

### Document everything twice

Every change to a feature, option, preset or workflow updates both kinds of
documentation in the same commit:

- **ELI5 docs for people.** Plain words and short sentences; what it is and why
  you would want it before how; step-by-step setup; one complete example; what
  you will see when it runs; every option with its default; common problems
  and their fixes.
- **ai-docs for agents.** The sections under `ai-docs/src`, with compiling
  examples in the codebase's own style. `LLMS.md` is generated from them by
  `node tools/ai-docs/docgen.mjs` and checked in CI with `--check`; never edit
  it by hand.

## The ClimbUK brand pack

This repository is the ClimbUK brand: tokens, logos, illustrations, photography, guidelines, templates and two Agent Skills. It holds no website or platform code, and no TypeScript, so the house rules for Effect, Nx and feature flags have nothing to apply to here. The brand scripts are plain Python using the standard library.

### Use the brand from an agent

- Load `.agents/skills/climb-voice` for any words and `.agents/skills/climb-visual-style` for anything visual; both for an asset with words on it. Run `python3 .agents/skills/climb-voice/scripts/check_copy.py FILE` on every piece of copy.
- Every colour and size comes from `tokens/brand.tokens.json`. Never type a value that is not in it.
- `ai/tools/brand_rules.py` answers brand questions as tools (`call(tool, arguments, venue_announced)`); `ai/kit.json` lists them.

### Logos and app icons

- Every logo, icon, favicon and app tile is transparent by default; each also comes on solid White, Dark Brown and Climb Orange. Logo files take the suffix `-on-white`, `-on-ground` or `-on-orange` (`logos/ClimbUK/ClimbUK_icon-monogram-on-ground.svg`); app icons sit in `white/`, `ground/` and `orange/` subfolders of `app-icons/favicons/` and `app-icons/app-tiles/`.
- Ask the logo tool, not memory: `call("logo", {"brand": "ClimbUK", "use": "favicon"})` returns the transparent `icon-monogram` and lists the three solid versions under `on_solid`; add `"fill": "ground"` for the Dark Brown file.
- Code that wants the old Dark Brown tile uses `icon-on-ground` or `icon-monogram-on-ground`.
- Rebuild with `python3 logos/_build/build.py && python3 logos/_build/sheet.py`, then `python3 app-icons/_build/build_app_icons.py`. All need `rsvg-convert` and Pillow.

### Install the skills elsewhere

- `npx skills add Climb-Group/Brand-System` offers exactly the two brand skills. The house skills synced into `.agents/skills` are listed in `skills-lock.json`, which `npx skills` treats as already installed and hides.
- `ai/open-in.json` holds the "Open in" links for Claude, Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Le Chat and DeepSeek. Most prefill a prompt; Gemini and DeepSeek have no prompt link, so their entry carries the prompt in `copy` for the page to copy first. None of these assistants has a link that installs a skill directly.
- `ai/packages/` holds a zip per skill (an assistant's skill upload), both skills together, and a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent package.

### Change the skills or the packages

1. Edit the skill under `.agents/skills/<name>/`. Keep the front matter strict YAML: quote any value holding `: ` or ` #`.
2. Run `python3 ai/agents/build_agent_kits.py` and commit `ai/packages/`, `ai/open-in.json` and `skills-lock.json` with the change.
3. Run `node --run check` and `node --run test`.

A house sync that adds or removes a house skill also needs step 2, or `--check` fails on `skills-lock.json`.

### Release the media kit exports

- `.github/workflows/media-kit.yml` renders the catalogue, builds the template package and runs the website repository's `climb_brand_media_kit/scripts/build_kit.py` to make `climb-media-kit-exports.zip`, then attaches it to a new `media-kit-<date>-<commit>` release. It needs the `MEDIA_KIT_BUILDER_TOKEN` secret (read-only on the private website repository). The builder comes from the `builder-ref` input, default `production`; never default it to a feature branch, since merged branches are deleted.
- The photo library is read from `climb-photo-library.zip` on the `photo-library` release; an optional `media-kit-exclude.txt` on the same release (one `folder/filename` per line) is passed to the builder as `--photo-exclude`; without the zip the kit has no photo library. Never put a photo with a readable name badge or a possible minor in that zip.
- The 4K motion clips and drawing PNGs are not part of this build.
